# Description

This respository is to be use to generate new Spikes by reusing the existing
Spike Plan and Spike Outcome templates to build a new project for a student or
developer to complete. A Spike being used to either build a minimal viable
product, to explore a possible solution or develop skills in a new expertise.

> Create spike solutions to figure out answers to tough technical or design
> problems. A spike solution is a very simple program to explore potential
> solutions. Build the spike to only addresses the problem under examination and
> ignore all other concerns. Most spikes are not good enough to keep, so expect
> to throw it away. The goal is reducing the risk of a technical problem or
> increase the reliability of a user story's estimate.
>
> When a technical difficulty threatens to hold up the system's development put
> a pair of developers on the problem for a week or two and reduce the potential
> risk.
